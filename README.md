## Challenges 

The first challenge I had was how I would use React's useState to instantly update the resume based on the information in the forms. I overcome my confusion of React state by reading through React's documentation on useState and watching a few videos on it. Another challenge I had was how I would make the webpage responsive on every screen size as the UI for mobile and desktop would have to differ greatly. I used multiple media queries to solve my problem.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned so much about React, specifically components and useState. There was a bit of a learning curve since this was my first React project, but I loved it because React allows me to create webpages much more quickly than if I just used plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
